Summary
An intern at your company has just wrapped up a project to create a password strength calculator. The tool works, but there's a catch—the code is a mess. It’s poorly structured, lacks comments, and doesn’t follow best practices. Now, it’s up to you to take this rough draft and turn it into a professional, industry-ready and open-source application. However, we didn’t want our competitor to use it for business purpose.
Your Mission: Your task is to step into the shoes of a software engineer and industrialize the intern’s code. This means transforming it from a basic, functional prototype into a polished, maintainable, and scalable piece of software.
